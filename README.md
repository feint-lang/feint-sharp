# Feint Targeting LLVM

This is an attempt to implement Feint as a compiler targeting LLVM with
the eventual goal of implementing Feint in itself.

## Implementation Plan

This version will be implemented in F# in order to compare the .NET/F#
ecosystem to OCaml.

NOTE: This version was started in the [feint-ocaml] repo.
